# codeforces
This repository contains all my downloaded codeforces solutions. Each folder in the repository corresponds to the problem published at codeforces.com. 
Inside the folder, there are two files -
* problem statement html file that describes the problem
* solution code that attempts to solve the problem

You can view problem & code submissions directly at codeforces by constructing URL -
* Problem URL - http://codeforces.com/contest/<problem_number>/<problem_char>: If the folder name is 1025-A, then the problem URL would be http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1025/A 
* Submission URL -
