# codeforces
This repository contains all my downloaded codeforces solutions. Each folder in the repository corresponds to the problem published at codeforces.com. 
Inside the folder, there are two files -
* problem statement html file that describes the problem
* solution code that attempts to solve the problem

Since the download being used to extract my solutions is not able to download just my successful submissions, it also ends up downloading blank submissions.
There might be a few empty solution code files.
