# codeforces
This repository contains all my downloaded codeforces solutions. Each folder in the repository corresponds to the problem published at codeforces.com. 
Inside the folder, there are two files -
* problem statement html file that describes the problem
* solution code that attempts to solve the problem

Since at times the download tool being used to extract my solutions is not able to download my submission successfully, it ends up creating blank/empty solution code file. Due to which there might be a few empty solution code files. In such cases, you can view code & submission details using following URL -
* http://codeforces.com/contest/<problem_id>/submission/<submission_id> : 
* Replace problem_id with actual problem id (folder name without char A/B/C/D..
* Replace submission_id with actual submission_id (solution file name format is - <problem num with char>-<submission_id>.py
