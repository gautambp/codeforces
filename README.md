# codeforces
This repository contains all my downloaded codeforces solutions. Each folder in the repository corresponds to the problem published at codeforces.com. 
Inside the folder, there are two files -
* problem statement html file that describes the problem
* solution code that attempts to solve the problem

You can view problem & code submissions directly at codeforces by constructing URL -
* Problem URL - http://codeforces.com/contest/<problem_number>/<problem_char>: If the folder name is 1025-A, then the problem URL would be http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1025/A 
* Submission URL - http://codeforces.com/contest/<problem_number>/submission/<submission_number>: If the folder name is 1025-A and the problem solution file name (which follows format: <problem_number>-<problem_char>-<submission_number>.py) is 1025-A-51030243.py, then submission URL would be http://codeforces.com/contest/1025/submission/51030243 

In addition to the submitted code, the codeforcecs submission page also lists all testcases and verdict if program passed each of the testcases.
